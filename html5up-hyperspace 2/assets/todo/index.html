<!-- bootstrap for Design

<!-- Div with a class of container-a bootstrap class which keeps everything within a
central column on the page. class of text center to centralize the text text
like to make it a light color text andthen margin of strength for in the y
direction. -->

<!-- H1 with a margin bottom of strength four-give some space at the
bottom and that says to do list.  -->

<!-- form for our search-give this a class of search that's our own class, which we'll use later on in Js. And inside
this just one input field, it has a class of form control and margin auto, so
both bootstrap classes to give it some styling. The type is text and the name is
search. We also have a placeholder called Search to Do's.  -->

<!-- Ul-list for all of our to do's-we give it a class of list group that is a
bootstrap class which is going to style these list items for us. -->
<!-- 
to do's class-our own class-so we can get a reference to this later on or maybe
style it in our own CSS. margin X direction of auto - centralize it and text hyphen light to give these a light colored text. -->

<!-- each li is going to be one todo-hard coding these to begin with. So each one has
a class of list hyphen group hyphen item that again is a bootstrap class to
style these list items.  -->

<!-- they have a display type-flex and justify content between and align items center-these are Flexbox alignment 
classes just to lay these out a little bit better. And it basically means that these elements
inside it are going to be displayed as flex items and they're going to be spaced
correctly.  -->

<!-- icons-give it our own class delete to use later on in either the JS or CSS -->

<!-- form at the bottom to add a new to do-class of Add-need a reference to this form later on in the JS
have a class of text hyphen center to centralize the text and margin in the Y direction of strength for inside. We
have a label for the input form with text light and that says add a new to do.
And then finally we have this input field with a class of form control and auto
bootstrap classes to style this a bit better. The type is text and the name is Add.  -->

<!-- we don't need a submit button at the bottom because, another way of submitting a form is to fill it out. And then pressing
enter and that submits the form as well. -->

So the background color is this hex and it's a purple color, the max width of
the container, which is this remember right here is going to be 400 pixels. So
now it's going to be a central column of 400 pixels in width in the middle of
our browser. Then we're using these two selectors right here to get the inputs
of type text when it's out of focus and also when it's in focus. And by
in-focus, I mean when we actually click it that is in focus. So we're grabbing
that and we're colorizing them. So the text is white and the background is this
transparent black. Again, we're using this alpha channel Rgba so we can use this
0.2 for the transparency. And then we have a max width of 400 pixels and no
border. So then we have the to dos the lies inside this thing right here.
Remember, this has a class of to dos. So all the tags inside there were styling
and giving those a background of this purple color. Then the delete icon, which
is the trash can, we're saying give a cursor of pointer so that when we hover
over them we get that little hand. So if we save it and preview now it looks
like this, it looks almost complete, but obviously nothing works yet. And if we
try to add something over here, we can't do So now we need to turn our attention
to the JavaScript. Now we have this template sorted and hook up all of this
functionality. Play 77. Project Preview and Setup 3min Play 78. HTML & CSS
