<!-- Div with a class of container-a bootstrap class which keeps everything within a
central column on the page. class of text center to centralize the text text
like to make it a light color text andthen margin of strength for in the y
direction. -->

<!-- H1 with a margin bottom of strength four-give some space at the
bottom and that says to do list.  -->

<!-- form for our search-give this a class of search that's our own class, which we'll use later on in Js. And inside
this just one input field, it has a class of form control and margin auto, so
both bootstrap classes to give it some styling. The type is text and the name is
search. We also have a placeholder called Search to Do's.  -->

bootstrap class which is going to style these list items for us. -->
<!-- 
to do's class-our own class-so we can get a reference to this later on or maybe
style it in our own CSS. margin X direction of auto - centralize it and text hyphen light to give these a light colored text. -->

<!-- each li is going to be one todo-hard coding these to begin with. So each one has
a class of list hyphen group hyphen item that again is a bootstrap class to
style these list items.  -->

<!-- they have a display type-flex and justify content between and align items center-these are Flexbox alignment 
classes just to lay these out a little bit better. And it basically means that these elements
inside it are going to be displayed as flex items and they're going to be spaced
correctly.  -->

<!-- icons-give it our own class delete to use later on in either the JS or CSS -->

<!-- form at the bottom to add a new to do-class of Add-need a reference to this form later on in the JS
have a class of text hyphen center to centralize the text and margin in the Y direction of strength for inside. We
have a label for the input form with text light and that says add a new to do.
And then finally we have this input field with a class of form control and auto
bootstrap classes to style this a bit better. The type is text and the name is Add.  -->

<!-- we don't need a submit button at the bottom because, another way of submitting a form is to fill it out. And then pressing
enter and that submits the form as well. -->
